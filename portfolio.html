        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>
            For the past 13 years i've completed 2 trades as an Electrician
            and a Carpenter. I've worked across all sectors from residential
            domestic to full on Industrial where i was a sparky at Bluescope
            Steel (Formerly known as BHP)
            I've always wanted to learn front-end web development and so i joined
            GA and after 2 lessons im super excited about my future career projectory.
            In my spare time i love going to gigs and playing guitar (music nerd), 
            making furniture and wood craft, scoping out cosy bars and wine holes 
            and relaxing in front of the fire :)
